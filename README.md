# Copycat

A simple CLI tool to copy and concatenate all the code from multiple files into one file for easy copy/pasting of an entire small codebase as text.

## Why?

I grow weary of hunting down all the code I want to paste into an LLM when I'm just prototyping some nonsense idea, so I'm over-engineering a solution.

And yeah, this is the nonsense idea.

## No.

Yeah, that would probably be a better idea. I'm making it easy to create insecure, buggy projects. But that's beyond the scope of this nonsense. :blush:
